Certainly! If you want an endpoint to retrieve all members across various study groups, you could design it like this:

**Endpoint for Getting All Members:**

- **Endpoint:** `/members`
- **HTTP Method:** GET
- **Description:** Retrieve a list of all members across Mussar study groups.

This endpoint would return a list of members, and you could include additional parameters to filter the results if needed. For example, you might allow users to filter members by specific study groups, roles (leaders, regular members), or other relevant criteria.

**Optional Query Parameters:**

- `/members?group_id={group_id}`: Retrieve members of a specific study group.
- `/members?role=leader`: Retrieve leaders of study groups.
- `/members?role=member`: Retrieve regular members of study groups.

Adjust the query parameters based on the specific requirements and use cases of your application.
